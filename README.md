World Shuffle is a simple game that tickles the brain of the user by taking a word and shuffle the letters around.
While the game itself is quite simple, the task of solving what word it is might be more challengin than you'd think.
The user will get to choose between three difficulties, where each difficulty is tied to a specific category.
A word will be randomly picked for the user to guess, and each correct word will provide a point.
The goal is to get as many points as possible, if the user guesses wrong five times, the game will be over!
