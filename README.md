# Word Shuffle

World Shuffle is a simple game that tickles the brain of the user by taking a word and shuffle around the letters.
While the game itself is quite simple, the task of solving what word it is might be more challenging than you'd think.
The user will get to choose between three difficulties, where each difficulty is tied to a specific category and contains
15 words.
A word will be randomly picked for the user to guess and each correct word will provide a point, and if the 
user guesses all words correctly in one difficulty, that level will be cleared.
The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible, if the user guesses wrong five times, the game will be over!

#### Playing the game
![Game Area](assets/readme-images/game-area.png)
  * This section appears once the user have chosen a difficulty, and informs the user what category the words are tied to,
  a box containing the shuffled word, a input for the user to type their answer, and a interactive button that lets the user 
  submit their answer.
  * The input features an auto focus so that the user don't have to click on the input window everytime they want to type
  in a guess, users are also able to press the Enter key instead of clicking on the guess button for convinience.

  * If the user reaches 0 life, the game will be over and a message will be displayed on screen and makes it clear to the user what the correct answer was, what score they ended up with and if they set a new high-score.
  * A button will also be provided for the user to allow them to play again, and restarts the game.
  ![Win Screen](assets/readme-images/win-message.png)
  * If the user clears a difficulty or wins the game by clearing all the difficulties a congratulatory message will be displayed and let them know if a new high-score has been set.
  * Here the user will be provided with two interactive buttons that lets them either continue to the next difficulty or quit the game.


### Future Features
  * I would like to implement more categories and maybe a feature that would allow the user to choose category.
  * Or if the user has cleared all the difficulties, add a new category to each difficulty.

   In general:
  * [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) has been a huge help for finding solutions when I've been stuck on coding problems or if wanted to create something specific but didn't know how to.
